I am excited to announce that a documentary has been made about TypeScript! It premieres on YouTube at 5pm British Summertime September 21st 2023!

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6s2pdxebSo?si=7X3eRhmSXLUnlGr5" title="TypeScript Origins documentary" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen></iframe>

I had the good fortune to be involved in the making of the documentary. In part this was thanks to my work on Definitely Typed. Another reason was my work on recording [the history of DefinitelyTyped](../2019-10-08-definitely-typed-the-movie/index.md).

When the documentary is released you will be able to find it on the [OfferZen Origins YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/offerzenorigins). When it goes out you'll have the chance to interact with some of the contributors (including myself) in a live chat.

I'm really looking forward to seeing how it turned out!
