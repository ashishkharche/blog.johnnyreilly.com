The common advice handed out in this situation is: \"add unit tests before you change it\". That's good advice. We need to take the implementation that embodies the correctness of the system and create unit tests that set that implementation in stone.

There comes a point when this is plainly untenable; it's just too much data to transcribe. At this point the temptation is to think \"it's okay; I can live without the tests.
